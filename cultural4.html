			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Taking a moment away from this modern day TV series, let’s look at some modern day facts. Out of the 50 states in America, only a mere 17 of them have legalized gay marriage. Why is it that it’s only acceptable to love somebody of the same gender in certain parts of this so called “free” country? Are laws prohibiting gay marriage unconstitutional? Of course they are. Taking a look at the first amendment, we see that it is faulty for the government to make any laws regarding many things, one of them being religion. If I were to ask you what one of the main causes of world wars is, gay people would not be an answer I would receive, guaranteed. Religion, on the other hand, is one of the main issues that have led to many worldwide battles. Why is it logical that something that causes no problems in the world, nor does it cause harm to anybody, has unnecessary restrictions placed on it? The world has bigger and better problems, such as soldiers in Afghanistan getting killed, or perhaps making abortions illegal, seeing as abortion is the equivalent to murder, but you don’t see women going to jail for that! Gay marriage is nothing but two people being legally connected by decision and being able to show their affection just as any other couple could. Cam and Mitch, though they are a fictional couple, are a wonderful example of the harmlessness of loving someone of the same gender.

<p>Unlike a homosexual relationship, a man and a woman can reproduce, but what about the men and women that physically cannot have a child because of health restrictions? What about all of the men and women that do, and decide they want to give up their baby? Those babies need homes also. Similar to Cam and Mitch’s relationship, many homosexual couples crave the full effect of having a family, and choose to adopt. Not only is this good for the couple being able to raise a child just like everyone else, but also it is good for the child being put into a home where they are raised to know what true love is. With the example given in the television series Modern Family, Cam and Mitch adopt their baby, whose name is Lily, from Vietnam. In other words, they gave a child that may have had no hope there, a new start on life. Some may say that it is wrong to raise a child with two dads, or perhaps two mothers. In reality, that kind of mindset is unjust.  Besides, as humans, who decides what is “normal” anyways?
