			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>All in all, psychology, whether we are educated on it or not, is essential to life. Those who study the psychology and its effects on mental health have the opportunity to make a difference in the world. Whether you’re like Derrick Guty who is a professional mental health therapist, or you’re like Gregory Pouliot who teaches abnormal psychology at EMU, it is a very important subject to have information on. Ranging from stress disorders to personality disorders, understanding psychology can help you understand why those things are happening to not only yourself, but also those around you. The brain is a very powerful thing, and we are lucky to have so many intelligent people to pass on their knowledge of psychology and human behavior. Aside from the facts, being conscious of psychological processes can make people more empathetic, and help the world become a more insightful place. </p>
