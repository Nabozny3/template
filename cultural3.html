			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Anyone who has ever seen the show Modern Family has witnessed two men in a relationship live a functional, loving life, just as any other average male and female couple could. In this show, Cameron Tucker, played by Eric Stonestreet, and Mitchell Pritchett, played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson, are a homosexual couple that live together with their adopted daughter Lily. Although unwed, it has been in their plans to one day change that. This gay couple has faced a decent amount of uncomfortable situations where people in their network of friends or family don’t fully accept the fact that they are they are two men in love. Through all of this, the couple still felt content seeing as they are happy together, and that is the most important thing they strive for. Cam and Mitch love each other, and decided that they aren’t going to change what makes them happy in order to satisfy others. Observing these two men to get an example of what a functional family looks like isn’t a bad idea at all. Similar to all functioning households, they have good times and bad times. What normal dwelling doesn’t? What matters is the care, love, and proper environment to make a house a home. </p>
<p>Modern Family is only one of the very many examples that could be used to explain that gay marriage is nothing beyond the norm nowadays. How “modern” is the television show Modern Family? Well, to answer that question, lets go back fifty years. Not a single show on television had a straight couple sleeping in the same beds together. Let alone a homosexual couple that adopts a child. Sure the show has some conservative points with two stay at home moms, but they still are paving the way with Cam and Mitch. In the show, most of the family and friends are very supportive of Cam and Mitch.  However, in the beginning, Mitch’s father was very strange and distant when it came to the idea that his son is homosexual. Not only Mitch’s father, but also Cam’s grandmother was against the whole idea of the two men being together. With time, Mitch’s dad came around and started to accept the idea that his son loved another man and that’s simply how it was and continued to be. In certain episodes he does get a bit weird here and there when he sees the two men hug, but other than that, he is accepting and loving of his son. To go along with that, the rest of the family is supportive in any way, shape, or form. Mitchell’s sister along with her husband and kids are all accepting and supportive of the way these men choose to live their lives. Mitchell’s father with his wife and stepson also support them. This support goes along on both sides of the family. Cameron’s sister is very supportive of them and is happy for them that they are together and living the life that they both deserve to live.</p> 
<p>Not only is this fictional show adding a gay couple into their storyline to make it more interesting, but they also apply Cam and Mitch’s relationship into real life social issues. In the show, the two men have been together for eight years. Between having a family together with their adopted daughter, dealing with their families unsupportive behaviors a few times, and dealing with all of the above plus waiting to get married, it is similar to real life problems. In the premiere of the fifth season of Modern Family, there was a proposal exchanged between the two men. Which only seems right. Some may wonder why the writers of the show waited five seasons for them to be engaged. Well recently, the state of California passed the law that allowed gay couples to be married in that state. Which is a clear indication that the writers have been waiting to put the proposal and marriage off until it was legal in the state of California for gay couples to be married.
