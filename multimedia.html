<br><u>
Composing in Context </u><BR>
Using this topic affected how the project was composed because we used specific clips from movies such a Wall-E, and interviews all about technology for the entire documentary. Not only that, but we tried to make the colors on the slides kind of give that “techno” feel (grays, certain fonts, etc.) rather than something bright and bubbly which would be more appropriate when talking about summertime or Eastern perhaps. Composing this issue helped me better understand this issue at hand because I got to see several different interviews from different people and got to hear their side of this controversy, rather than just having one thought and sticking to it. The only problems I really encountered had to do with using iMovie. Other than that, the group worked together very well and we incorporated all of our work and ideas into this documentary and it flowed very well. As far as the audience goes, they play the role of viewing. The audience will see this video and hopefully understand the underlying negativities that too much dependence on technology has, and could continue to put on us. 
<br><br><u>
Process</u><br>
We chose this particular topic because we all heard that Emily wrote her cultural analysis on technology and immediately agreed that we could get a lot of good information out of this topic. We are all aware that nowadays technology is becoming almost too big of a part of our daily lives and it would be something that would be simple yet very informative to do a documentary on. I think that the most challenging part of this was honestly learning how to use iMovie efficiently. The only reason it was difficult is because I got my MacBook less than a year ago, so I have never used iMovie until now. Although it was hard at first, now I have a general idea of how it works! Gathering the data, the interviews, and working with my group all worked out very easily. Our topic was pretty clear and easy to find things to say about it. Putting it all together was the hardest part! I worked through that by asking others for help in my group, as well as us all using Google to see how to do things, and that helped us out a lot!
<br><br><u>
Research</u><br>
The research that was most beneficial was the statistics that we used in our documentary. These statistics gave a more in depth data to the idea we were trying to get across. Aside from the personal interviews that were VERY helpful and really showed the audience the point we were trying to get at, the statistics backed up all of the opinions of the interviewees. I don’t think there’s anything that I could say was least beneficial, because with our topic, it was very easy to get great statistics and other information to incorporate into our project. Everything we used helped us greatly!
<br><br><u>
Collaboration</u><br>
Working in this group was very good. We all came up with a lot of different ideas that helped our project come together. Everybody put a lot of thought into planning how we would visualize what we are trying to get across with our documentary. For our interviews, we each interviewed a couple of people, and once we completed that, we chose the best interviews to incorporate into our documentary. We also worked together to find video clips and ideas of clips and/or scenarios that we could use to prove our point. Working in the group gave me a bigger creativity span, and helped me a lot. 
<br><br><u>
Project Management</u><br>
The majority of the time that we met as a group, we discussed options for how we would plan the documentary. Once we did that, we assigned each of us certain things to do that would help in putting it all together and make each of our workloads a bit easier. If we would have had more time, the documentary would probably have been a little neater, and maybe had more special effects added to it. Since we were limited on time, we did the best we could, and I still think it turned out pretty well!!
<br><br><U>
Documentary Design</u><br>
In my opinion, the most effective way we got our point across during this documentary was the personal interviews. We have a lot of different people stating their thoughts on technology, as well as telling their personal stories about things such as grades in school being impacted from being too attached to technology, and plenty of other examples that give first hand explanations as to why we think technology is becoming overloaded. I was the one who put the documentary on iMovie, so I kind of put a little more of what I thought would be best. However, all of the group members gave me good ideas. For example, Emily gave me the idea to cut our voices out of the interview to save time, and therefore we could use a slide with text asking the questions rather than having our unclear voices repeated several times asking the same questions.
