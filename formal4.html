			<p>After giving a general idea of what those who study psychology end up doing, it will give a better understanding hearing from people who studied Psychology themselves.
	</p><p>Derrick Guty, a limited license professional counselor from Lansing Michigan, said that there was “not a single ‘ah ha’ light bulb kind of moment” that inspired him to become a mental health counselor.
</p><p>	“My decision to become a counselor evolved. After high school I joined the 	Marine Corps because I had no idea really what I wanted to do…. had I gone 	right into college I thought it would have been a huge waste of money and 	time. During my senior year I decided I was going to enlist in the Marines. It 	was actually while in the Marines, ironically, where I developed an interest in 	reading and school. It was during my first deployment in Iraq that I began to 	learn, and find an interest in human processes, especially emotion.
</p><p>	After I finished up with the Marines, I began working as a child development 	teacher and family mentor with military families just helping them 	navigate the unique stressors they faced as being a part of the military.  	These jobs were not counseling per se, but they were my intro to social 	services. It was during my undergrad where I majored in human 	development and really took a liking to counseling specifically. The rest is 	history.”
</p><p>
</p><p>	After asking him this, I put forward a few more questions about the mental health aspect of psychology from his point of view. When asked what his favorite part about his job was, he said:
</p><p>	“I get to interact with so many people. Also, I appreciate the challenge of 	learning perspectives other than my own. People are so unique and doing 	this job requires me to never judge or assume something about someone 	because you never really know someone else’s story… It is just so amazing to 	meet people who are struggling with so much yet find some way to manage 	and grow from their circumstances.”

</p><p>	Being a mental health therapist requires not only a lot of knowledge and understanding of the brain, but also many other qualities to deal with clients. According to Derrick, “Compassion, acceptance, humility, understanding, resilience… Really as I think about this I would say the traits I want for myself are the same traits that I would want for my clients. This is why I think it is so important to be aware of oneself and be self-evaluative. For myself I just have to be mindful, open, and willing to take feedback.“
</p><p>	The mind is a very powerful thing. Studies have shown that being around people who are negative make you less likely to feel happy and upbeat. However, being a counselor and dealing with sad people all day requires you to stay positive and see the light at the end of the tunnel. I asked Derrick if dealing with sad and unhappy people ever rub off on him and he said,  “It does yes, but again it does not benefit the client if I’m sad with them. I have to check myself and my emotions/thoughts/nonverbal reactions. If I’m struggling with someone else’s suffering (compassion fatigue) and don’t have the ability to resolve that, then I should go seek counseling to help me out. “
</p><p>	Also, Derrick admits that sometimes he does get nervous when dealing with patients who are suicidal or extremely difficult to help. “There is nothing wrong with being nervous. This is an emotion that I can use to help me out and stay on top of my toes in the moment. I don’t have to react stereotypically nervous, I can react calmly and within appropriate limits which will best serve the client.”
</p><p>	Being nervous is something everyone experiences often throughout his or her lifetime. Aside from being nervous while working with people, sometimes it is just simply difficult to help people. When asked what the hardest things to help people with were, he said,  “When clients struggle with psychotic disorders, I have a hard time… basically when someone struggles with an alteration of reality, it is just hard to understand sometimes. I am not saying its impossible but it’s difficult. I’ll say this which can maybe shed some light; imagine someone telling you your reality is not real. To me that sounds terrifying, just so frightening because what else do you have to grasp onto? “
</p><p>	Additionally to helping people live life normally, like said before, psychology plays a huge part in these ordeals. Derrick took numerous Psychology classes during school. 
</p><p>	“How has having a background in psychology been helpful for me? Having an 	educational background in psych, counseling, and human development has 	been helpful because it has given me ways of understanding other humans.  	But I want to state that these theories… which have guided my 	understanding of human beings are not universal. Human beings are 	complex and theories provide a general understanding but the 	understanding really unfolds when working with people during the 	counseling process.”
	
</p><p>	As you can see, understanding psychology is essential to human life. When talking to an abnormal psychology professor named Gregory Pouliot from Eastern Michigan University, I asked him what sparked his interest in psychology. He said, “For me what sparked my interest was when I was an undergrad in college. I took an Intro to Psych course… seeing different aspects (thinking of therapy), realizing the complexities of the mind, thought and cognition, I saw it as ‘there’s a lot here that I never thought of’ and that’s where my interest came from”
</p><p>	Aside from having an interest in it, I was curious to see what he would say when asked what reasons he believes psychology is important to be educated on. “It’s important because we all interact with other people, all want to have relationships, and you have to have a basic understanding of psychology to understand people around you and what’s going on around them.” An example he gave was one of his students saying, “Learning about [mental] disorders makes me see this friend differently”. “It gives people empathy,” he said. 
</p><p>	Since this report has been mainly on the mental health aspect involving not only the discipline of psychology, but also the careers involving it, I wondered had he ever had a student who struggled in his class due to anxiety, depression or other things related.
</p><p>	“Yes, I think it’s a hard balance in some ways since we are also trained as 	therapists. Obviously… you have to recognize the boundaries from serving as 	a therapist versus a professor. I talk to the student, try to understand and 	connect them to appropriate resources such as counseling, student disability 	offices, or work with them during office hours to figure out things. It’s 	important not to fall into a therapist role… I treat it the same as any other 	professor would.”
</p><p>
</p><p>	When asked if he thinks psychology can help solve peoples’ problems, including with mental disorders and other things similar, he said,
</p><p>	 “I think it can certainly help, but is also important to recognize that 	knowledge is not curative. For example, say I’m suffering from depression 	and learn all about it and how it’s cured, that doesn’t mean that I’m going to 	feel better. Therapy is what helps more. Knowledge is important and can 	help, [it] can lead people to want to make some changes…. But I don’t think 	that reading a textbook can help someone fix their problems. Even therapists 	sometimes seek out therapy for help”
 
</p><p>I also asked Mr. Pouliot if he thinks that being informed about Psychology has given him a better understanding of other people and made him less quick to judge them.
</p><p>	“Yes and no. Yes in the sense that it allows me to think about people in a 	more complex way and allows me to put things in context and to try to 	understand people in a way I wouldn’t have if I didn’t understand 	psychology, but at the same time, the literature suggests that we all make 	snap judgments and we all carry stereotypes. It’s not human kind to not have 	normal judgments, but it does help one to appreciate others in a particular 	way.”
