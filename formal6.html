			<p>Aside from those already stated, OCD is another common mental dysfunction that psychologists, therapists and others in similar careers deal with. The following information is the summary of an article titled "A Review of Psychotherapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder". Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a psychological disorder that causes those who have it to act impulsively on their compulsive thoughts. Those affected have behavioral problems, such as repetitively engaging in certain behaviors, that in which doing so helps to relieve stress. OCD can cause many problems in peoples lives, such as sleep deprivation, anxiety, and even unemployment in very extreme cases. This psychological disorder subconsciously forces people get obsessive impulses to do certain things, such as repetitively checking if the door is locked or washing their hands over and over because of fear of contamination and germs.
	</p><p>According to psychodynamic interpretations, OCD can be caused because of problems that occurred early in the anal stage of human development. One of the ways that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be treated is by seeing somebody and receiving Cognitive Behavioral Theory. This is a treatment that can be done is several ways, however, often times it is when individuals are counseled, and eventually exposed to what triggers their OCD. Most of the time, the stimuli that cause the obsessive thoughts and behaviors are no longer triggered and do not respond. Another way that it can be treated is through other therapy methods done by somebody educated on psychology, in which the individual is helped be brought towards more realistic thoughts versus thoughts of anxiety and over-excessive feelings of responsibilities that relate to their OCD. 
</p><p>	Many people who have OCD, approximately 75% of them according to this article, unfortunately experience comorbidity, meaning that another mental disorder occurs simultaneously, leading to not help the problem of OCD, but making it worse. Anxiety, social phobia, depressive disorders, and panic disorders are the most common comorbid disorders that therapists come in contact with. 
</p><p>	Intensive CBT may be used in such cases. During intensive CBT, sessions are longer and held over a 3-5 week period, versus a 12 week period. Though it can drastically help many, only about 25-40% of those reached a complete recovery. Manualized treatments are also sometimes used, where there is 12 sessions between the psychologist and patient and they focus on creating exposures for the patient to practice outside the session. Most patients experience improvements in OCD severity, but there are no significant outcomes recorded. Self-help manuals helped some of those affected as well, and in severe cases, a psychiatrist who knows just what the patient will need may prescribe medication. 
	</p><p>The scary thing about using medication versus using therapy to treat these issues is that not all antidepressants are tested on actual patients. An article by Jenny Manzer titled "Antidepressants Not Studied on Majority of Psych Patients: Many Patients are Taking Drugs Not Proven to Work for their Type of Depression." Speaks more about this. The article begins by saying according to The American Psychiatric Association, about 2/3 of patients are unable to participate in antidepressant testing trials. Many patients are actually taking meds that have never been shown to help their sort of depression. Dr. Mark Zimmerman who works at Rhode Island Hospital did 39 studies on antidepressant medications. Those whom had major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder were unable to be counted in the trials. A lot of other individuals can also not be tested for purpose of their safety, and some who were mildly depressed versus moderately depressed were also not counted.  Because of the fact that so many people are excluded from these tests, such as those with substance abuse, suicidal intention, BPD, it raises uncertainty with whether or not these general medications are actually helping most of those people they are prescribed to. Without data and without placebo-controlled studies, it is hard to say how well these things actually are working. 
</p><p>	Aside from some medications not being certain, there are many prescription drugs out there that have been proven to show improvement to those who have taken them. Prozac, Xanax, Celexa, and other anxiety and anti-depressant medication all have been proven effective. Nevertheless, there are always risks to taking narcotics or strong medications, so it is always warned to never exceed recommended dosages.
</p><p>	These two articles summarized previously are two very good explanations of what those involved in psychology deal with. Mental disorders play a huge part in our population nowadays, and without the proper treatments, people can live lives in misery and complete unhappiness. Suicide is 100% preventable. With the help of Physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists and other therapists, issues that lead to suicide can be obstructed for the most part. Working in these sorts of fields may be challenging, but in the end, helping people and even saving a life can be one of the most rewarding feelings one can achieve.
