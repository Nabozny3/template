                <p>Watching this video left me feeling upset that people in the world can be so harsh, and make somebody feel bad for being the person that they are.
                Within the first few seconds of the video, I could immediately tell that it was going to be a story that somebody was brave enough to share in order to help 
                other people who face the same, or similar problems as he. Thr purpose was not to make people feel guilty, or for Trevor to get attention, but 
                instead, it was to give people who are gay an example to look up to. He wanted to be a source of inspiration, to give people hope, that
                although it's not always an easy experience to go through, that it does, in fact, get better.</p>
                 
                <p>Trevor uses his own life story to tell how cruel people can be towards gays when they don't agree with their behavior.
                At the beginning of the video, Trevor is very depressed and angry about his homosexual uncle's suicide after dealing with
                the constant bullying from family and friends. Trevor feels left alone, and is so lost that he now has nobody there
                to support him. After telling his story, Trevor talks about how 5 years later, he has hope, and finds it easier to get by. He lets
                viewers know that regardless of the fact that he went through traumatic events, he stayed strong, and eventually things began looking up. He
                used a structure in which he explained how people may be feeling now. Emotions such as sad, depressed, angry, hurt, hopeless, and so on were portrayed through
                his letters. But then, Trevor fast forwarded to five years later, and showed that the bad feelings do not last forever.</p>
               
                <p>Maybe not only did the video help people who are gay and struggle with bullying, threats, and suicide attempts for being told
                they are not right for being who they are. Maybe, just maybe it also gave some insight to people who do not agree with others being gay. 
                I hope that this video has helped many people, including gay, straight, and even people who have suffered from similar situations as Trevor.</p>
                
                <p>This video's structure can help me revise my project by making it more personal, rather than just making it more so generally stated. 
                Not only that, but I could also write my project in a way that explains more of how technology has influenced myself to pick my career path, instead of 
                writing it about how technology and finance, my major, go hand in hand with each other. Watching this narrative has definitely given me some pointers on how 
                my project's paper should be written, and that I should do it more personally and more connected to myself. </p>

                <p> The group of people that were targeted in this South Park episode was both adults and children who play World of Warcraft. The social issue that I got out of this show was that communication has been deteriorating slowly, seeing as nowadays, people communicate through technology more so than face-to-face interactions. For instance, the characters in this show dedicated 7 weeks of their lives to playing a game strictly to obtain a level of high power to beat somebody else who dedicated their entire life to the game! These kids decided that doing so was more of importance to them than doing outside activities, eating well, and even going to the bathroom on their own! Such behavior made them very unhealthy and un-energized. </p>

<p>Technology has its way of taking over, especially with all the advances that have been made in the past century. I remember back when I was younger, I used to be addicted to playing The Sims. I became a hermit, and spent almost every day after school playing the game for hours. Things such as this is an issue because things such as gaming tends to take over people’s lives, making them less social, less connected to their surroundings, and they begin to develop a sense of strong attachment to things that are not good to spend all of your time with.  </p>

<p>I think that the creator of this video did a good job on explaining how technology can disconnect people from the outside world. It was very humorous how after the 4 kids agreed to participate in using all their time to become a very excessively powerful player, as time progressed, they ended up getting fatter and fatter. Not only that, but their skin developed a good amount of pimples, and they had no energy left within them. It showed how much artificial intelligence can affect the younger generation nowadays. It’s true that some kids these days get so wrapped up in video games, television shows, and other technologies, even cellphones, that they tend to forget that an a whole other world exists around them. Technology is a wonderful thing in the world, but sometimes, it has a way of taking over.</p>

                <p> This advertisement really captures Detroit and all of it’s great qualities, while also talking about how that city has been through a lot of rough things. It shows clips of things such as the Joe Louis Fist Statue, The Fox Theater, and other statues and artwork scattered throughout the city. It really shows that although Detroit has been through a lot, it is still a very beautiful city.
</p>
<p>It is really great that they incorporated Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself” in the commercial because Eminem is from Detroit himself. It shows the pride he has in the city, and not only that, but it is the heart of where automobiles originated from, also known as Motor City. It talked about luxuries and strengths, and Detroit knows all about that!

</p><p>The tagline “Imported from Detroit” is very important in the commercial as well because the commercial is filmed throughout popular areas of Detroit, and although these cars are not just manufactured in Detroit, that is where the production of them began. This commercial gets very personal and meaningful, rather than just talking about how great their product is, and that is something that grasps people’s attention.
