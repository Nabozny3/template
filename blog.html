                <h1>In Class Activity 1</h1>
                <p>Watching this video left me feeling upset that people in the world can be so harsh, and make somebody feel bad for being the person that they are.
                Within the first few seconds of the video, I could immediately tell that it was going to be a story that somebody was brave enough to share in order to help 
                other people who face the same, or similar problems as he. Thr purpose was not to make people feel guilty, or for Trevor to get attention, but 
                instead, it was to give people who are gay an example to look up to. He wanted to be a source of inspiration, to give people hope, that
                although it's not always an easy experience to go through, that it does, in fact, get better.</p>
                
                <p>Trevor uses his own life story to tell how cruel people can be towards gays when they don't agree with their behavior.
                At the beginning of the video, Trevor is very depressed and angry about his homosexual uncle's suicide after dealing with
                the constant bullying from family and friends. Trevor feels left alone, and is so lost that he now has nobody there
                to support him. After telling his story, Trevor talks about how 5 years later, he has hope, and finds it easier to get by. He lets
                viewers know that regardless of the fact that he went through traumatic events, he stayed strong, and eventually things began looking up. He
                used a structure in which he explained how people may be feeling now. Emotions such as sad, depressed, angry, hurt, hopeless, and so on were portrayed through
                his letters. But then, Trevor fast forwarded to five years later, and showed that the bad feelings do not last forever.</p>
               
                <p>Maybe not only did the video help people who are gay and struggle with bullying, threats, and suicide attempts for being told
                they are not right for being who they are. Maybe, just maybe it also gave some insight to people who do not agree with others being gay. 
                I hope that this video has helped many people, including gay, straight, and even people who have suffered from similar situations as Trevor.</p>
                
                <p>This video's structure can help me revise my project by making it more personal, rather than just making it more so generally stated. 
                Not only that, but I could also write my project in a way that explains more of how technology has influenced myself to pick my career path, instead of 
                writing it about how technology and finance, my major, go hand in hand with each other. Watching this narrative has definitely given me some pointers on how 
                my project's paper should be written, and that I should do it more personally and more connected to myself. </p>
