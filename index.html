			<h1>All About Me:</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Jenna Nabozny, I am a freshman here at MSU studying Psychology. 
			Although it's not the best major, I do have a plan for after. Once I graduate, I want to go to grad school and become a mental health therapist for people 18 and under.
				I am really looking forward to having a rewarding career like that where I help people on a daily basis.
			</p><p>
				My birthday is October 4th, and I was born in 1995, making me 18 years old. I have a brother and a sister, both who are in their mid twenties,
				making me the youngest of the family. I have the cutest little dog named Oliver. He is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and I love him to death!
				</p><p>
					Aside from that, I have a boyfriend of over a year named Paul, and he is very important to me. Him, along with
					my two best friends, Amber and Chelsea, are the greatest people in my life aside from family. Other than that, I have a 
					normal life just like anybody else, and although it's not perfect, I wouldnt change a thing!
				</p>
