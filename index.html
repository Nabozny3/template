			<h1>All About Me:</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Jenna Nabozny, I am a freshman here at MSU studying Psychology. 
			Although it's not the best major, I do have a plan for after. Once I graduate, I want to go to grad school and become a mental health therapist for people 18 and under.
				I am really looking forward to having a rewarding career like that where I help people on a daily basis.
			</p><p>
				My birthday is October 4th, and I was born in 1995, making me 18 years old. I have a brother and a sister, both who are in their mid twenties,
				making me the youngest of the family. I have the cutest little dog named Oliver. He is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and I love him to death!<a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=30ts1lk" target="_blank"><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/30ts1lk.png" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>
