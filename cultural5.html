			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>This issue of people not supporting gay marriage can easily be resolved. To begin with, those with authority should be more understanding. Sometimes, itâ€™s hard to see different points of views when you have never been through the feeling of loving someone of the same gender. However, if humans changed their mentality, and realized that everybody is different, including their sexuality, us as an entire population could put a halt to unnecessary criticizing on something that brings somebody happiness. If the majority of us can agree that gay marriage is harmless, these laws can be banned, providing those who love each other to legally spend their lives in warm environments. It seems like a more difficult task than it really is. All we need is a simple change of heart, and we could let this issue go, leaving people undisturbed, as well as not feeling like a criminal for having strong emotional connections to another person. One day, I predict that discrimination against gays will be treated as discrimination against blacks came to be. This horrible victimizing will be put to an end. </p>
