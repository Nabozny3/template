			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>What is love? Well, according to www.dictionary.com, love is a noun that explains a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. Oddly enough, nowhere in that definition it is mentioned that love is something that has to be strictly between a man and a woman. Love can be between any two people who share that feeling of warmth and intimacy, regardless of sex. If this is the case, why is there a law that prevents two men or two women from sharing their love with each other until death do them part? Not only are these laws stopping people, but also society’s unwillingness to be accepting of homosexual relationships is. The fear of being judged or disowned leads many to put on a second personality, being unable to express themselves the way they are. In contrast to all those against it, Lady Gaga once stated, “Don't you ever let a soul in the world tell you that you can't be exactly who you are”. Although there are several famous quotes and sayings similar to the one mentioned that depict that being yourself is the best way to live, there is still a constant argument on whether or not being gay is an exception to that rule. Who are we as humans to put restrictions and laws on other’s feelings? Quite honestly, we do not have the authority or any form of control to restrict what another person feels, or finds normal. </p>
