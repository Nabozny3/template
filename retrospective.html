		<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
		
	<p>As it is clear and obviously known, it is of utmost importance to be skilled in literary concepts nowadays. Reading and writing is very crucial to be educated on if you want to be successful and or intellectual in life. Taking classes such as WRA 110 has given me a more broad range of knowledge I was not fully informed of previously. During the course of this class, I actually learned several new things that I was never once taught in high school. Although I personally am not majoring in anything related to writing, it is always beneficial to be able to adequately form a paper, especially when it comes to applying for jobs, applying to get into graduate school, simply just passing your college undergrad courses and everything in between. Learning these techniques are very important, especially during this time of our lives.
	</p><p>At the beginning of the semester in WRA 110, we worked on a fairly small report that consisted of explaining what our major was, along with listing other facts and information about it. It was a simple task seeing as it revolved around facts about yourself and your future goals or plans; along with describing why you have interest in this major and what makes it important. Of course it wasn’t just simply that. There were indeed guidelines that we had to follow and certain formats that we needed to use, but it was nice to be able to have more freedom than what I am used to from high school and all of the preceding years. After completing this essay, I realized that we were also required to make a web page version of the assignment. Doing so, at first I was very confused; there was a lot to learn about web design that I was very unfamiliar with. After being taught about things like HTML codes, how to change the style, and most importantly, how to work on the website called GitHub, those things have become much more simple to me. This could be something good to know in life such as if you ever need to create a page for work, or even if you want to make one for yourself to, for example, sell something you make or for any other personal use reasons. 
	</p><p>It may sound crazy, but before attending Michigan State, I was never taught how to write an essay properly in MLA, APA, or any other format. The cultural analysis proposal, the next assignment in this class, was required to be in one of those special formats. Consequently, I had to do some reading and research myself to strictly adhere to the necessary formats. It was definitely a great learning lesson for me and taught me things that I will carry with me throughout my college career and beyond. Aside from this project being a bit more of work than the first, I had more fun doing it. This report gave me the opportunity to share something I feel strongly about while also incorporating some sort of media into it that I enjoyed as well. For those planning to take this class, you could have a lot of fun writing this. It is always nice to be able to write on something that you enjoy, rather than something that was strictly given to you to follow.  
</p><p>	I can tell you from experience that you should not put off working on your formal research paper. I did type it all up and get most of it done according to plan, however, once I reached the time to do the interviews, I was stuck. I tried reaching out to many professors and other people who had a career in the field I was researching, and that was not an easy task. Again, it was a nice project because you could write about anything you choose that you feel passionate about, but if I could go back, I would have gotten the interviews started a lot sooner. I ended up getting my last interview done the day before the project was due, and that was very stressful. Aside from that, this project taught me a lot. I have never interviewed strangers like this before, and aside from learning how to incorporate an interview into a 3,000-word essay, I also learned how to talk to people in a professional manner when asking them questions about their life. Patience is very important, and taking notes or maybe voice recording what they say would probably be the best option so you do not forget any important quotes.
</p><p>	My most recently completed project was the multimedia remix proposal. That was an awesome project that taught me a lot of new things. For this project, we again were required to interview others for a video documentary that we had to create on our topic. Just like the other assignments, we also got to choose what topic this one was on – my group and I chose to discuss the overload of technology. We had to make a visual presentation for this project, and it was a bit of a learning experience for all four of us. Using iMovie to make the documentary was something we were all pretty unfamiliar with, but after a little bit of messing around, we quickly understood the main points that helped us accomplish everything we needed to. The fact that this was a group project was very helpful as well. As always, working with others can help you learn new ideas, get a broader range of creativity, and it’s also good at teaching each member how to cooperatively come up with one final product. These are skills that help everyone not only now, but also later in life. The workforce, for example, is a place you need to learn to work with others when you don’t get to choose the people you are employed with. Out of all of the projects we have worked on, I would say the multimedia remix one was by far my favorite. I really liked the freedom we had to put it together the way my group and I thought would be best, and it was really fun to learn all the new things about programs on my MacBook, as well as meeting some pretty cool people in my class. This is great because aside from needing to know and fully understand how to properly read and write, I would say the second best thing I learned from this class would be working with others who I would never have spoke to if it weren’t for this class assignment.
	</p><p>Some people are forced to take writing classes and absolutely dread the fact that they have to do so. For example, I have a friend who is not the best speller, and writing papers comes very difficult to her; she despises classes like this. Although people don’t always enjoy these classes, I think they are something that benefits us all in many ways. Like I said before, knowing how to efficiently read and write a formal essay is a very important skill to have in life. This class was a review of the basics, plus added in new things that I have never worked on or been introduced to before in writing classes. Because the class was half online and I kind of figured out a lot of things on my own, I also felt that I learned responsibility management, which is a great thing to take out of especially a pre req. class. Personally, I think that was good because it required me to use my brain and figure things out to succeed, in contrast to high school where everything was practically spoon fed to me. 

</p><p>	Though to some it may seem like writing papers can be long yet simple in comparison to the workload of other classes, there are many things that I could advise those who are taking the course to keep in mind. First and foremost, make sure you are following the guidelines of how the essays or projects are supposed to be set up. Next, it is also very important to make sure you read the directions for each assignment very thoroughly. I have made the mistake of only briefly reading the requirements to come to realize I made mistakes and I had to go back and change a lot of things. Revision of the essay is always very important. It is not against the rules to have a peer look over your work and get another opinion on whether or not your assignment is done well, or even to get some ideas on what you could do to improve it. We have had to do peer editing in this class once or twice, and for those who took it seriously, it helped out quite a bit!
</p><p>	When it all comes down to it, writing classes are very important for college students to be able to proficiently be able to compose essays for any courses that may require them. I am more than positive that those whom, like myself, want to go to graduate school are most likely required to write a number of essays to stand out and be competitive in their desired field. Not fully understanding how to write a formal essay could eliminate anyone’s chances of getting their spot in the program, or maybe getting that internship he or she has always wanted. Not only that, but classes such as these teach us to work in groups, how to talk to people better and to have a more businesslike and professional way of communicating. 
</p><p>	 I cannot stress the significance of being proficient in writing, not to mention writing 3,000 word papers on a topic you choose yourself. It can be challenging, but it is great to put our brains to work and to bring our thinking outside the box. These assignments that we got in WRA 110 were all very good at making us do just that! Now that I look back at it, I realize that I really did learn a decent amount of important skills that I will carry with me throughout my life. I would highly recommend this hybrid class. It teaches you motivational skills to work on your own time but with specific deadlines, as well as many other things that I have listed above. For anyone who is considering taking this class, I would definitely suggest it!
