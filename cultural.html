			<h1>Executive Summary</h1> 
			<p>A social issue the world still faces today is the controversy on gay marriage. The essay that follows this explains that being attracted to members of the same sex is something that is becoming the norm in today’s society, although some people can’t seem to get a grip on it. I will talk about the shown Modern Family, and how a gay couple, Cameron and Mitchell, live a happy and normally functioning life, although they are not straight. In the end, I intend to show that love is love, regardless of whom it is between, and that this couple is a perfect example. Omitting the laws preventing it can solve such controversies on gay rights, as well as showing society that love is love, regardless of who the love is between. We as a society can overcome this social issue. </p>
