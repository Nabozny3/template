			<h1>Psychology is the study of the brain and all of it's functions. Nowadays, with increasing numbers in mental illnesses, those with an education on psychology are becoming more in high demand. Disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder are a few of the many things that those who go into the mental health/theraputic field of psychology oftentimes deal with. Without psychological studies that show what exactly is going on in the brain of those who struggle with these illnesses, proper treatments and medications would not be provided for those in need. Psychology is a very important thing for everybody to be at least generally educated on. Not only does understanding psychology give us a better understanding of ourselves, but also opens up more empathy towards other people. In this research essay, I interviewed two people who are well trained in the field of Psychology, and they both said that knowing it has given them a better outlook on the world. To sum it up, knowing psychology can help a lot of issues that occur in the world, such as why people are the way they are. That is why I felt it was necessary to write about this. Read on for a bit of interesting information, and to hear from two people who have studied psychology themselves!</h1>
