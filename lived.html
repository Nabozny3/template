		<h1>Technology and Finance</h1>
		<p>Nowadays, technology is everywhere that we look. Between computers, Wi-Fi, hand held devices, and all sorts of other things; it’s safe to say the world is becoming more and more technologically advanced with each year that passes. It is hard for the average human to avoid technology on a daily basis, seeing as how essential it has become in our daily lives. If you think about it, 40 years ago, who would have thought cellphones would be able to do almost everything a desktop computer could do? We went from having few black and white televisions to the majority of us now being able to watching movies and TV shows in HD from our mobile phones. I mean, we have even sent a man to the moon! All of these examples require great advances of technology to perform. I wouldn’t be surprised if the next big thing in technology was personal jet packs or flying cars! At this rate, those things will be customary in no time. </p>

<p>Whether we realize it or not, technology has a lot of significance to us all in several ways. One of those, for instance, would be that it helped me choose my major. A form of technology that has really impacted my life would be credit card machines. Rewind to two and a half years ago when I got my first debit card. It wasn’t just any average debit card, but my own, black, Susan G. Komen debit card with a pink breast cancer ribbon along with cute pink accent designs. I almost felt like I had all the money in the world at the swipe of this plastic! Splurging was such a simple task, seeing as I hardly ever physically saw how much money I was spending in a day. One uneventful weekend, I decided to go to 12 Oaks Mall with some good friends and my debit card that was now a few months old. This card was hardly swiped at this time, so I decided it was time to put it to work. Using this wonderful easy money access card to make every purchase, I eventually came across a very awkward situation… “Uhm, Ma’am, your card was declined… Would you like to try that again?” The cashier at Express said to me. Turns out, I didn’t have enough money left in my account to purchase any more items. I had officially drained my checking account.</p>

<p>I could have kept track of my spending by looking at receipts and giving a rough estimate of how much I started with, and how much I deducted with every purchase I made. Although I wasn’t responsible with my money, this moment made me realize how easy it is to overspend with these “magic money cards”. Nowadays, so many people are in debt, and have terrible credit because they are unable to manage their money well enough. Some common problems I noticed from family and friends are things such as using debit or credit cards to do unnecessary online shopping, people going through a mid life crisis that decide to spend all their money on boats or motorcycles, and even simply spending money they don’t have on the newest and latest iPhone. After the incident where I mistakenly drained my account, I have been a lot more cautious with my spending. I started to put half of every paycheck I received into my savings account, as well as always using the convenience of my online Bank of America mobile banking app to keep track of my money; another form of technology that has helped save me from financial struggles. </p>

<p>Two and a half years ago, before this ever happened, I thought I wanted to be a teacher for high school. However, after coming across my uncomfortable situation and seeing how important being responsible with money is, I started to realize teaching kids was not something I’m meant to do. I took some time to think about how important finances are to the world and all small and major businesses. Thinking about how wonderful I would be in such a career field, I now am attending one of the greatest business schools in the nation majoring in finance. One day, I hope to be a successful certified financial planner. Seeing as I have learned my lesson on how to be good with money myself, I realized that putting that skill towards assisting others for a living would be very worthwhile. I want to be somebody that helps people of all ages create budgets and retirement plans, give insight on what stocks my clienteles should invest their money in, help limit their spending on things that are illogical, and all aspects related to living a financially stable life.</p> 

<p>Not only is finance a good field because of the salary you can get out of it, but it is also good because having knowledge with currency is a fantastic way to be able to support a family, get started on saving for retirement, and also being able to start on funds for my future kids’ college, cars, all the while having extra money set aside for unplanned incidents that call for unfortunate expenses. Everybody that is old enough to work, for the rest of their lives should have somebody to guide them on how to be wise with their earnings. Many people these days will use credit cards and get themselves into a lot of trouble. Not only that, but things also like investing in a stock that ends up not doing well, or taking out loans for college where the interest rates are absurd all involve planning to make sure you can afford for these things to happen.  One day, I will help as many people I can to avoid those circumstances.</p>

<p>Businesses of all sizes need to be able to manage their money sensibly. Things they have to think about are how much do they pay monthly for bills, how much they pay on products, or food if it’s a restaurant, how much they will be paying employees, and also setting aside money incase need of a repair or anything unplanned. After all the costs and expenditures of owning a business of their own, they also must make sure that they have enough left over to live off of themselves. Not only would I say businesses should have a financial planner, but even the average person who just work a 9-5 job. Oftentimes, people, including younger self, don’t realize that they are spending as much as they are, and this is why financial planners are important. People like myself will be someday, are out there to help individuals be able to spend wisely, and be responsible with their money to be able to end up well off.</p>

<p>After my experience with clearing out my bank account all for some new clothes, I came to realize that being in control of your money is an important thing that will get you far in life.  That is a situation that has greatly impacted me to act differently, and even choose a career path; that is when I discovered a true skill I acquired. At the age of 18, I can say that I have saved up enough money to be able to take about 5 trips to Italy and back, and maybe even have some cash left over. Although my first debit card put me in an awkward situation, it is a form of technology I am beyond thankful to have. It is much more convenient than carrying around cash and change, and makes me feel safe that my money can’t be stolen right out of my wallet. I am thankful that I learned from my mistakes, and cannot wait to one day be able to prevent people from making the same mistakes as I, or in some cases, prevent even worse things from happening.</p>
