			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Psychology was always a class that every student in high school eagerly waited to take. In comparison to Algebra, Chemistry and English classes, learning about new things such as behind the scenes of dreaming and other daily brain functions was likely to be the most fascinating things they taught you back in those days. Although many students are aware that it is a very intriguing subject, what exactly is psychology?</p>
	<p>According to dictionary.com, psychology is the study of the human mind and its functions. To elaborate a little bit more, it is research that comes to understand how living beings think, feel, and act. Understanding the brain is the first and foremost to understanding psychology. Learning about all the different parts of the mind, what they do and how issues within them can lead to disorders plays the most important role. One of the most important focuses in psychology is diagnosing and treating mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, and many others. Because this is such an enthralling subject, many young adults are pursuing their career in this field.</p>
<p>	The majority of those who study psychology have an immense desire to help people who have suffered emotional issues from traumas or other factors, and or figure out why they are the way they are now. “The love of digging the archives of realities of life, it fills my heart to the brim with total happiness. Attending to people's problems gives me lot of energy to live…. I want to fulfill my passion to work in psychology and help others,” said guest Suraiya Shaibu on psychology.about.com. Not only does psychology help people learn more about themselves, but also gives them a better understanding of other people.</p>
