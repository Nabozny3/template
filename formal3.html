			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Psychology is a semi general discipline to go in to. Those who advance in this field study the brain, mental processes, and all things in between. Although it is very broad, there can be specific things that can be studied once the student successfully completed their undergrad. Frequently, students exceed their education after completing a psychology undergrad for a PhD in something along the lines of working with those who have mental illnesses or disorders. (i.e. psychologists, therapists, mental health counselors, etc.) Those who do so are trained to dig deep into the mind and the past of their patients to figure out why things are the way they are now.
	</p><p>Psychology and mental disorders go hand in hand. Like stated above, those who study psychology study things such as anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar disorder, etc., and without those careers, it would be near impossible to find cures and different therapies to accommodate everybody’s needs. In other words, trained counselors, therapists and psychiatrists assist people who need it, and even go as far enough as saving a life. 
</p><p>	About four years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that over 38,000 suicides were reported for that year. Not only that, but since then, suicide has been bulletined as the tenth leading cause of death in America. If we are looking at this data on average, somebody’s life ends every 13.7 minutes nationwide because of this tragic, increasing issue. This is a problem that is commonly overlooked by many “average” people who see sadness as easy to cope with in comparison to those affected by depression. The real question is why does depression, along with other mental disorders for that matter, occur? 
</p><P>	To be put easily, thoughts and or attempts of suicide are brought upon by problems in the brain, or traumatic events that trigger sadness in one’s mind in response to any horrific events they may have gone through. A quick example, as found on www.iancommunity.org, mothers and fathers who have children with autism have a frequent occurrence of mood disorders. Bipolar and depression, being of the most common disorders in the nation, are also the two most found in these cases. At the end of this report, a chart shows the severity of these disorders, such as whether these parents have tried to harm themselves, or have been hospitalized. Due to the increasing number of people falling under the unfortunate spell of mental illnesses, those in the psychology field are becoming more in high demand.
